## GANS

Stands for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

A GAN is a type of machine learning model that uses two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, to create new
data that is similar to the data it was trained on. The generator creates new data, and the discriminator tries to tell
the difference between the real data and the fake data created by the generator. The two networks are trained together
in a zero-sum game, where the generator tries to fool the discriminator and the discriminator tries to correctly
identify the fake data. This process allows the generator to create increasingly realistic data over time.
