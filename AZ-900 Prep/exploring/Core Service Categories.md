# Core Service Categories

## 1. Compute Services
Compute services are the foundation of the cloud, providing the processing power for your applications.

-   **Azure Virtual Machines (VMs):** Offers scalable, on-demand computing resources. You can create Windows and Linux virtual machines in minutes. It's an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering.
-   **Azure App Service:** A fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps and APIs. It supports various languages and frameworks (.NET, Java, Node.js, Python, etc.). It's a Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering.
-   **Azure Functions:** An event-driven, serverless compute service. It allows you to run small pieces of code ("functions") without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. You only pay for the compute time you consume.
-   **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):** A managed container orchestration service based on the open-source Kubernetes system. It simplifies deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.
-   **Azure Batch:** Enables large-scale parallel and high-performance computing (HPC) batch jobs. It's ideal for workloads like rendering, media transcoding, and complex simulations.

## 2. Storage Services
Storage services in Azure provide scalable and secure data storage for a variety of scenarios.

-   **Azure Blob Storage:** Highly scalable and cost-effective object storage for unstructured data like text, images, and videos.
-   **Azure Files:** Offers fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via the standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. Think of it as a network drive in the cloud.
-   **Azure Disk Storage:** Provides high-performance, durable block storage for Azure Virtual Machines. It's like a virtual hard drive for your VM.
-   **Azure Data Lake Storage:** A massively scalable and secure data lake for high-performance analytics workloads. It's built on top of Azure Blob Storage.

## 3. Database Services
Azure provides a wide range of managed database services to fit your application needs.

-   **Azure SQL Database:** A fully managed relational database service based on the latest stable version of Microsoft SQL Server. It's a PaaS offering that handles management functions like patching, backups, and monitoring.
-   **Azure Cosmos DB:** A globally distributed, multi-model database service. It supports NoSQL data models and offers turnkey global distribution and elastic scaling.
-   **Azure Database for MySQL/PostgreSQL/MariaDB:** Fully managed, scalable, and secure database services for popular open-source databases.

## 4. Networking Services
Networking services enable you to connect and manage your cloud resources securely and efficiently.

-   **Azure Virtual Network (VNet):** Enables Azure resources like VMs to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and your on-premises networks. It's your private network in Azure.
-   **Azure Load Balancer:** Distributes incoming network traffic across a group of backend servers or virtual machines, ensuring high availability and reliability.
-   **Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN):** A global CDN solution for delivering high-bandwidth content. It caches content at strategically placed physical nodes across the world to provide faster delivery to users.
-   **Azure ExpressRoute:** Lets you extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection, offering higher security, reliability, and speeds with lower latencies than typical internet connections.
-   **Azure Firewall:** A managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network resources.
-   **Azure VPN Gateway:** A service that sends encrypted traffic between an Azure Virtual Network and an on-premises location over the public internet.
-   **Azure DNS:** A hosting service for DNS domains that provides name resolution using Microsoft Azure infrastructure.

## 5. AI + Machine Learning
Azure provides a comprehensive set of AI and machine learning services to build intelligent applications.

-   **Azure Machine Learning:** A cloud-based environment you can use to train, deploy, automate, manage, and track ML models.
-   **Cognitive Services:** A collection of pre-built AI models that you can use in your applications through APIs. Categories include Vision, Speech, Language, and Decision.

## 6. Internet of Things (IoT)
Services to connect, monitor, and manage billions of IoT assets.

-   **Azure IoT Hub:** A managed service that acts as a central message hub for bi-directional communication between your IoT application and the devices it manages.
-   **Azure IoT Central:** A fully managed IoT SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) solution that makes it easy to connect, monitor, and manage your IoT assets at scale.

## 7. Management and Governance
Tools to manage and govern your Azure environment.

-   **Azure Monitor:** Provides a comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments.
-   **Azure Policy:** Helps to enforce organizational standards and to assess compliance at-scale.
-   **Microsoft Defender for Cloud:** A unified infrastructure security management system that strengthens the security posture of your data centers.

## 8. Security
Services to protect your data, applications, and infrastructure.

-   **Azure Key Vault:** A cloud service for securely storing and accessing secrets, such as API keys, passwords, or certificates.
-   **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD):** Microsoft’s cloud-based identity and access management service.
