# Deployment model selection

This document explains four cloud deployment models, highlighting their features and use cases with Microsoft Azure.

1. **Public Cloud**: Services are delivered over the internet by third-party providers like Azure. It's cost-effective
   and scalable, ideal for businesses like e-commerce startups that need to manage variable traffic and reduce IT
   overhead.

2. **Private Cloud**: A dedicated environment for a single organization, offering high security and control. It can be
   on-premises or hosted. Azure provides options like Azure Dedicated Host and Azure Stack. This model suits
   organizations with strict data regulations, such as banks.

3. **Hybrid Cloud**: This model combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between
   them. It offers flexibility, letting organizations keep sensitive data in a private cloud while using the public
   cloud's scalability. Azure Arc is a key tool for managing these environments. A healthcare organization is a good
   example, using the private cloud for patient
   records and the public cloud for other applications.

4. **Multi-cloud**: This approach involves using services from multiple cloud providers to leverage the best features of
   each and avoid vendor lock-in. For instance, a manufacturing company might use Azure for AI and another provider for
   data analytics. However, this can add
   complexity to management and security.

In conclusion, the best cloud strategy depends on an organization's specific needs and may involve a mix of these
models. It's a decision that should be regularly reviewed as the organization evolves.
