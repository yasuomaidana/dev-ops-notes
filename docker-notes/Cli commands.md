# Basic Docker CLI Commands:

## Run
`docker run`: Use this command to create and start a new container based on an image. You can specify options such as port mapping, volume mounting, and environment variables.

`docker ps`: This command lists the running containers on your system, providing information about their status, names, and IDs.

`docker images`: Use this command to view a list of available Docker images on your system. These images serve as the blueprints for creating containers.

`docker build`: This command is used for building a Docker image from a Dockerfile, which is a script that specifies how to create the image.

`docker pull`: Use this command to download Docker images from a container registry, such as Docker Hub.

`docker stop` and `docker start`: These commands allow you to stop and start containers, respectively.

`docker rm`: This command removes one or more containers. Be cautious with this command, as it permanently deletes containers.

`docker rmi`: Use this command to remove one or more images. Make sure you don't need the image anymore before deleting it.

## Advanced Docker CLI Usage:

`docker exec`: You can execute commands inside a running container using this command. It's useful for troubleshooting or interacting with a container's shell.

`docker logs`: This command provides access to the logs generated by a running container, which is helpful for debugging and monitoring.

`docker-compose`: Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and manage multi-container applications in a single file. You can use the docker-compose command to start, stop, and manage these multi-container setups.

`docker network`: Docker allows you to create custom networks to connect containers. This command helps you manage network configurations for your containers.
